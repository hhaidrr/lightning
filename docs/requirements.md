# Aspirations
We want to use Adyen as a central case-study for our platform. Similar to them, we want to operate on a global scale and be an engineering first saavy platform which really pushes the enveloper of financial technology.
However we do not want to compete on the ground Adyen has already covered. This implicates user switch-over cost, meaning we will have to create an order of magnitude greater iterations of the solutions Adyen already has, from the ground up. That is a hard task when the company is in it's management prime, the original founder is still around. Instead, we will look at the areas Adyen does not operate in, and be complementary to it. Offering solutions at Adyen scale and treatment but for other solutions.

# Push adoption of new technologies
- Stablecoins
- SoftPOS
- etc.
